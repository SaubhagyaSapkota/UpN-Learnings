## Topic Learned

**useContext hook in React** (2025-07-23)
- Helps to consume values from a React Context directly, without needing to pass props manually through every component level.

**useMemo hook in React** (2025-07-24)
- It caches a computed value so it's not recalcualted on every render unless dependencies change.

**useCallback hook in React** (2025-07-24)
- It caches a function so it's not recreated on every render unless dependencies change.

**Custom hooks in React** (2025-07-24)
- Reusable functions that use React hooks (useState, useEffect, etc) inside them.
- Helps in Encapsulate logic, reuse code across components.

**Error Boundaries** (2025-07-24)
- A component that catches JavaScript errors in its child components tree, and logs those errors.
- And display a fallback UI instead of crashing the whole app.
